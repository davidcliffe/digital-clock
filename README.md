## Overview
This is simple digital clock project I completed using HTML, CSS, and JS. The first objective of the project was to learn how JS adds functionality to webpages, 
making them far more dynamic and interesting. The second objective was to experiment with the Document Object Model (DOM) and practice manipulation of elements 
using DOM functions and commands.

## Key Learnings
  * Javascript (basic level) can be learned quickly and provides numerous ways to add functionality to webpages.
  * The DOM is the interface to controlling and accessing a webpage. All hail the DOM!!
